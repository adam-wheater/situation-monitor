Fix Contracts
Fix Sector heat map
fix click on map tooltip no longer pops up modal i.e earthquakes. no longer shows modal to go to data
click on undersea cable to show modal for cable, i.e who owns, it, between what countries, etc.
BestTime says found results, but never populates matches (even though i literally provided the data for the places i need to show as a minimum lol?)
everytime i load the app, i need to 'click save key' again on the pentagon tracker.
pentagrom tracker doesnt show status for current businest from best time?
