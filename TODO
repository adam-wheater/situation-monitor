[DONE] Add weather warnings to the map (US NWS alerts)
[DONE] Add flight radar for likely military/transport aircraft (OpenSky heuristics)
[DONE] Add naval hubs / “ship” layer (OSM infrastructure via Overpass; not live AIS)
[DONE] Ensure Pentagon pizza tracker works (BestTime + curated venues fallback; requires running local proxy)
[DONE] Add regional powers military bases (OSM military=base/naval_base/airfield via Overpass)
[DONE] Add nuclear power plants (OSM nuclear plants/generators via Overpass)
[DONE] When zooming in, make icons smaller so the countries remain visible

NOTE: Live ship tracking (AIS) generally requires an API key/provider; this repo currently uses free/open sources only.
