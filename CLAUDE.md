# AUTONOMOUS MODE

- DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS
- DO NOT ASK FOR CONFIRMATION
- APPLY CHANGES DIRECTLY
- USE TOOLS IMMEDIATELY
- FOLLOW AI_MODE.txt STRICTLY

QUALITY RULES:
- The project MUST have Playwright E2E tests in tests/e2e
- If fewer than 3 meaningful E2E tests exist, YOU MUST ADD MORE.
- Every user-facing feature MUST have at least one E2E test.
- If E2E tests fail or are missing, FIX OR CREATE THEM.

TODO.md is the source of truth.
